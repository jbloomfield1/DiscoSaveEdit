Save Game Editor for Disco Elysium

This is a very basic save editor.  It will let you change the number of available skill points, money amount, and the number of healing items for health and morale.

Downloed the binaries from the releases section https://github.com/jbloomfield1/DiscoSaveEdit/releases/tag/Release
You should probably make sure the game is not running.  It did work fine for me while testing with DE running, but I can't promise the same for you.
Run DiscoSaveEdit.exe
Click Open
It should open directly to the default save path for Disco Elysium, but if you have somehow moved it, you will need to find the location.
***Warning***
Make a backup of your save file.  I am not responsible for ruining your game.
*************
Select the ZIP file for the save you want to edit
Change the values you want to change
Click Save
Confirm you want to save and overwite the open ZIP file... Or cancel, whatever.
Click Exit and confirm with OK to close the editor
Run the game
Load the save


***Disclaimer***
This is LITERALLY my first program of any kind.  I hyperfocused learning C# for 2 days while on lisdexamfetamine (very disco, but I have an Rx, so chill), and this is my first project.  Feel free to take the code, and do whatever you want with it.  I may add more features, or this may be the end of it.  Use it at your own risk.
